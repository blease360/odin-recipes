    <h2>Homesteader Cornbread</h2>
    <p>"My husband and I have made this recipe several times and we love it," says community member FUNKYDEMON. "This is a sweet dense cornbread but I find that it's sweetness is a good complement to a spicy chili. It keeps fairly well but any cut edges will dry out quickly — however since the bread is dense it will still be moist just beyond the cut edge. Only cut off as much as you plan to eat at a time. We also like this at breakfast with a little molasses."</p>
