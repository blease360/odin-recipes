    <h2>Fantastic Focaccia Bread</h2>
    <p>If you've never made bread from scratch 
        before, focaccia is a great place to
         start. This simple, straightforward 
         focaccia recipe comes to life in a 9x13 
         casserole dish and doesn't require an 
         elaborate kneading process, making it an 
         attainable and delicious project for 
         beginner bakers. </p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>½ teaspoon honey </li>
             <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast </li>
             <li>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) </li>
             <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
             <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
             <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided </li>
                
         </ul>
         <h4>Steps</h4>
             <ol>
                 <li>In a large bowl, dissolve honey and yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
                 <li>Add 1 cup flour, salt, and 3 tablespoons olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir until combined and then work in the last cup of flour. Knead the dough until smooth, elastic, and soft, about 7 minutes. Add only enough flour to keep the dough from being sticky. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
                 <li>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Place in greased 9x13 inch pan or baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                 <li>Poke dimples in the bread and drizzle 1 tablespoon of the olive oil on top. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.</li>
                 
                 
             </ol>
